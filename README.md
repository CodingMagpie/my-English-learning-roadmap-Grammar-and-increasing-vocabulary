### Set goals:
#### Short-term:
- make learning process more **fun** and **exiting**, so I dont _use much will power to learn new things_.
- pick up a few sourses of information and just focus on them
- milestone to accomplish. Spend 300 hours on learning english, to become a "dungeon master".

  - study grammar with chosen course and practise, because it`s a just mess in my head right now.   100% time: 20% get information/ 20% analyse information/ 60% practice (maybe even with chatGPT)
  - start to thinking in English
  - increase amount of words I know, and that I use:
    - use Anki, or any other program
    - create own cards based on materials you learn

  - create learning project in my database and put information from learning there. 

#### Long-term:
- make english as my 3rd "native" language and use it 70% of time +
